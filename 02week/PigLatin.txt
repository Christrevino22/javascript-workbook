1. find the first vowel
// if the first is a vowel, then you add "yay" to the end.
// example: egg -> eggyay
// if the first vowel is in the middle of the word,
// then you split the word, and swap the halves, and add "ay" to the end.
fox -> f   ox   -> oxf -> oxfay
//if the word doesnt have a vowel, you can make something up
